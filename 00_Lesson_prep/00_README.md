# Preparing for the workshop
Here we put prerequisites for the workshop
As well as the learning objectives 

## Checklist
- Tell participants to make a github account
- Windows users download and install GitBash
- Mac users download and install git
- All: download and install Anaconda


## Day 1

If you are running Windows, you will need to install Git for Windows following the instructions [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell). *Participants should install Git/Gitbash before day 1*

The default shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, and Bash is available in all versions, so no need to install anything. You access Bash from the Terminal. The easiest way to find it is by using the magnifying glass symbol at the top right corner of your page and search "Terminal". You should open it up and it's a good idea to right click the icon at the bottom of your screen and choose Options > Keep in Dock.

### Data and code for Day 1
Before today's workshop, we sent out a link to a folder called `workshop_data/` that you should have downloaded. You should save these files exactly as they are in a folder on your Desktop called `workshop_data/`.

### Expectations for Day 1

At the end of the teaching day 1 each student should have a project folder called `world_cities_workshop/` that contains three subfolders, `data/`, `scripts/`, and `documents/`. In the `data/` folder should be one .csv file called `netherlands-cities.csv` containing population data and coordinates for the 5 largest cities in the Netherlands. The `scripts/` folder should have one script called `map.py` that was provided at the start of the workshop, and the `documents/` folder should have one text file called `data-documentation.txt`.

## Day 2

## Day 3

For Windows users, Git should be installed already on your computer as part of your Bash install from Day 1. 

Mac users need to install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from [this list on Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/). Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click Open on the pop up window. After installing Git, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program. *Participants should install Git before Day 3*

### Data and code for Day 3
We will continue to use the data from Day 2 on cities etc. _____
