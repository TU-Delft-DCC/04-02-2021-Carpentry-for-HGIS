# Preparing for the workshop
Here we put prerequisites for the workshop
As well as the learning objectives 

## Checklist
- Tell participants to make a github account
- Windows users download and install GitBash
- Mac users download and install git
- All: download and install Anaconda


## Day 1

If you are running Windows, you will need to install Git for Windows following the instructions [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell). *Participants should install Git/Gitbash before day 1*

The default shell in some versions of macOS is Bash, and Bash is available in all versions, so no need to install anything. You access Bash from the Terminal. The easiest way to find it is by using the magnifying glass symbol at the top right corner of your page and search "Terminal". You should open it up and it's a good idea to right click the icon at the bottom of your screen and choose Options > Keep in Dock.

### Data and code for Day 1
Before today's workshop, we sent out a link to a folder called `workshop_data/` that you should have downloaded. You should save these files exactly as they are in a folder on your Desktop called `workshop_data/`.
