    "Executing code in a python interpreter or directly from the command line is useful, but we also want a way to edit and annotate code and go through some process of trial and error when we're solving problems on our own. Anaconda installed JupyterLab, which is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
