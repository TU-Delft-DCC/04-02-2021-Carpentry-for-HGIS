Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stresses on objects.An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object. We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.\n"
