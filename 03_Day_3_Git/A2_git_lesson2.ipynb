    "# Making a change to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "## _____ adding something to the map.py script\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving changes to the staging area with `git add`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project, `git add` specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things in the staging area), and `git commit` then actually takes the snapshot, and makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have anything staged when you type git commit, Git will prompt you to use git commit -a or git commit --all, which is kind of like gathering everyone to take a group photo! However, it’s almost always better to explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might commit changes you forgot you made. The staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want to commit as a single snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's check the status of changes that git knows about using `git status`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a message that you are on the branch \"master\", there are no commits yet, and there is one untracked file - the `map.py` that we just made changes to. We need to add these changes to the staging area to let git know we want to commit the latest version. We do this by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git add <name_of_file>`\n",
    "\n",
    "so, in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git add map.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that git gives pretty helpful messages when you interact with it on the command line - in this case, it tells us we should use git add to track this file and get the changes ready for committing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Committing changes and adding a message with `git commit`\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `git commit`, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add` and stores a copy permanently inside the special .git directory. This permanent copy is called a commit (or revision) and each one has a short identifer code that can be used to point to the version of your file if you ever need to revert back to it or investigate changes made. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `-m` flag (for “message”) to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why. If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option, Git will launch nano so that we can write a longer message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good commit messages start with a brief (<50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence “If applied, this commit will...” . \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it with our `map.py` script. This is the only file in the staging area, so the message we include in our commit can pertain only to it. If we had made changes to multiple files, for example changed parts of another script, added a new data file, or added lines to the data documentation text file, and we had added those to the staging area as well, we would be writing a commit that summarises the changes to ALL of those files. You can add all the changed files to the staging area at once by using `git add .`, but since we only changed one file we called it by name. Now, we're ready to make the commit by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git commit -m \"<my message here>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a good commit message here - maybe something like ______. Remember, keep it short and sweet, but also memorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we hit enter, we have successfully stored our first commit to our local git repository! To be sure, let's run:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "We should see a message that we are on branch \"master\", there is nothing to commit, and the working tree is clean. Nice!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to verify that our commit was saved is by using the command `git log`, which shows us the project's history of commits. `git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order. The listing for each commit includes the commit’s full identifier (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the git commit command earlier)the commit’s author, when it was created, and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run `ls` in our project folder at this point, we will still see ____. That’s because Git saves information about files’ history in the special .git directory mentioned earlier so that our filesystem doesn’t become cluttered (and so that we can’t accidentally edit or delete an old version).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, the workflow for adding and committing changes to files using Git is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `$ git status` to see the files that have been changed and are awaiting commit\n",
    "2. `$ git add <file_name>` to add one file at a time to the staging area or `$ git add .` to add all files that have been changed since the last commit\n",
    "3. `$ git commit -m \"<descriptive message>\"` to commit the latest version of file(s) and describe the nature of the changes made"
