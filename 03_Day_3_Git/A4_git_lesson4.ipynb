    "- try `git push` - get an error message because there is no branch in the remote repository called 'yourname' so it helpfully suggests we create one by set-upstream command\n",
    "- `git push --set-upstream origin <yourname>` - you should see a message that a 'Branch 'yourname' set up to track remote branch <yourname> from origin'\n",
    "- `git status` - your branch is up to date with 'origin/yourname' nothing to commit, working tree clean\n",
    "- from now on, any new changes can be added (`git add .`), committed (`git commit -m \"message\"`) and pushed to GitHub with `git push`\n",
    "- check on GitHub - you should see a message saying that changes were pushed less than a minute ago. \n",
    "- click on branches and show all, select 'yourname', here you should see a new file called gizmo.py that you created and if you click into it, you should see the function you defined."
