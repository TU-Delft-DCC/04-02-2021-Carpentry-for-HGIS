## Before getting started
**About the gizmo challenge:**
We want to challenge you today and expose you to a complete software development workflow. This will give you a comprehensive overview of how to make use of best practices in software and inspire to yo further.

> This is a Python challenge. Create pull requests (PR's) to this repository to solve it. Upon PR submission, the GitHub action robots will check your code and report back how well you did. You can then add more commits to your PR until all tests come back green, which means you win!

### We dont expect you to finish this long exercise today, but we hope you can solve today the easiest ones from 1 to 7
It would be great if you also eventually finish the rest of the exercises, that will be a great achievement.
