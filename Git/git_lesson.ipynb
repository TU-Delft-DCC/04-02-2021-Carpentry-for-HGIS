    "# Version control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is focused on understanding and implementing version control with Git to keep track of changes to a code-based project. We'll talk about the utility of version control systems for tracking changes to local projects, and how it can be used to enable remote collaboration and crediting of multiple authors to a project hosted in a remote repository like GitHub. This material draws from the [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) lesson from the Software Carpentries. "

    "# Setup requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows users, Git should be installed already on your computer as part of your Bash install from Day 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mac users need to install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent \"mavericks\" installer from [this list on Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/). Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click Open on the pop up window. After installing Git, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program. For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8) use the most recent available installer labelled \"snow-leopard\" available here. \n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people. Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way. You can think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your more recent version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote collaboration\n",
    "It seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word’s Track Changes, Google Docs’ version history. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative writing with traditional word processors is cumbersome. Either every collaborator has to work on a document sequentially (slowing down the process of writing), or you have to send out a version to all collaborators and manually merge their comments into your document. The ‘track changes’ or ‘record changes’ option can highlight changes for you and simplifies merging, but as soon as you accept changes you will lose their history. You will then no longer know who suggested that change, why it was suggested, or when it was merged into the rest of the document. Even online word processors like Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online do not fully resolve these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Individual work\n",
    "Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded).\n",
