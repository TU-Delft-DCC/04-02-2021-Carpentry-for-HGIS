    "# Version control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is focused on understanding and implementing version control with Git to keep track of changes to a code-based project. We'll talk about the utility of version control systems for tracking changes to local projects, and how it can be used to enable remote collaboration and crediting of multiple authors to a project hosted in a remote repository like GitHub. This material draws from the [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) lesson from the Software Carpentries. "

    "For Windows users, Git should be installed already on your computer as part of your Bash install from Day 1. \n",

    "Mac users need to install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent \"mavericks\" installer from [this list on Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/). Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click Open on the pop up window. After installing Git, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program. For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8) use the most recent available installer labelled \"snow-leopard\" available here. \n",

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people. Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way. You can think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your more recent version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote collaboration\n",
    "It seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word’s Track Changes, Google Docs’ version history. \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative writing with traditional word processors is cumbersome. Either every collaborator has to work on a document sequentially (slowing down the process of writing), or you have to send out a version to all collaborators and manually merge their comments into your document. The ‘track changes’ or ‘record changes’ option can highlight changes for you and simplifies merging, but as soon as you accept changes you will lose their history. You will then no longer know who suggested that change, why it was suggested, or when it was merged into the rest of the document. Even online word processors like Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online do not fully resolve these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Individual work\n",
    "Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded).\n",

    "# Make the `world_cities_workshop/` folder into a local Git repository\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in implementing Git for version control on any project is initializing a new Git repository in a folder in the main folder of that project. This is why keeping everything organized in subdirectories in one place is especially useful! For this workshop, our project folder is the `world_cities_workshop/` folder that should be stored on your Desktop, so we will initialize a new Git repository there. When we initialise a git repository in our main folder, all the contents of every subfolder therein will be automatically trackable with git...so we only need to do this step once in the main `world_cities_workshop/` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, in your terminal you should `cd` into the `world_cities_workshop/` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ cd world_cities_workshop`\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we will run our first git command to initialize a git repository in this folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git init`\n",
    "\n",
    "And just like that, we've started a local repository that is ready to track changes for us. Pretty neat! Of course, we're still in the driver's seat - Git requires our input about what to track, what to ignore, and when to save or \"commit\" changes that we've made to our files and folders. For now, we can check that the git repository has indeed been initialised by running the `ls` command with a flag, `-a` that shows all files and folders, including hidden ones that git has created:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ ls -a`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see in the output a hidden folder called `.git`. This is where git will store all the information from commits you make based on changes in your projects, and also where you can revert to previous versions and specific commits if you ever need to. This folder needs to stay put so that the project remains tracked with git and we don't lose information about changes we've made - the choice to hide it makes it a little bit harder to delete (which we don't want to do)! :) \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do one last check to make sure our git repository was set up successfully in our `world_cities_workshop/` directory. We'll ask git to report on its current status using:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a message indicating that you are on a branch called \"master\" and that there is nothing to commit yet - this makes sense because of course we haven't made any changes yet. That's coming up!\n",

    "## Moving changes to the staging area with `git add`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project, `git add` specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things in the staging area), and `git commit` then actually takes the snapshot, and makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have anything staged when you type git commit, Git will prompt you to use git commit -a or git commit --all, which is kind of like gathering everyone to take a group photo! However, it’s almost always better to explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might commit changes you forgot you made. The staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want to commit as a single snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's check the status of changes that git knows about using `git status`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a message that you are on the branch \"master\", there are no commits yet, and there is one untracked file - the `map.py` that we just made changes to. We need to add these changes to the staging area to let git know we want to commit the latest version. We do this by running:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Committing changes and adding a message with `git commit`\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `git commit`, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add` and stores a copy permanently inside the special .git directory. This permanent copy is called a commit (or revision) and each one has a short identifer code that can be used to point to the version of your file if you ever need to revert back to it or investigate changes made. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `-m` flag (for “message”) to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why. If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option, Git will launch nano so that we can write a longer message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good commit messages start with a brief (<50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence “If applied, this commit will...” . \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it with our `map.py` script. This is the only file in the staging area, so the message we include in our commit can pertain only to it. If we had made changes to multiple files, for example changed parts of another script, added a new data file, or added lines to the data documentation text file, and we had added those to the staging area as well, we would be writing a commit that summarises the changes to ALL of those files. You can add all the changed files to the staging area at once by using `git add .`, but since we only changed one file we called it by name. Now, we're ready to make the commit by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git commit -m \"<my message here>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a good commit message here - maybe something like ______. Remember, keep it short and sweet, but also memorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we hit enter, we have successfully stored our first commit to our local git repository! To be sure, let's run:\n",
    "\n",
    "'$ git status'\n",
    "\n",
    "We should see a message that we are on branch \"master\", there is nothing to commit, and the working tree is clean. Nice!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to verify that our commit was saved is by using the command `git log`, which shows us the project's history of commits. `git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order. The listing for each commit includes the commit’s full identifier (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the git commit command earlier)the commit’s author, when it was created, and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we run `ls` in our project folder at this point, we will still see ____. That’s because Git saves information about files’ history in the special .git directory mentioned earlier so that our filesystem doesn’t become cluttered (and so that we can’t accidentally edit or delete an old version).\n",

    "## Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, the workflow for adding and committing changes to files using Git is:\n",

    "1. `$ git status` to see the files that have been changed and are awaiting commit\n",
    "2. `$ git add <file_name>` to add one file at a time to the staging area or `$ git add .` to add all files that have been changed since the last commit\n",

    "# Using `.gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis? Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. What’s worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so let’s tell Git to ignore them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by creating a file in the root directory (in this case, the `world_cities_workshop/` folder) of our project called .gitignore. We can use two shell commands, either `touch` or `nano` to create the file. If we use `nano`, the file will be created and opened with the nano editor in one step, but since it's empty and we still need to decide what to list in there, let's use `touch` to simply create the file. Make sure you are in the `world_cities_workshop/` folder (not any subfolder):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We can edit this file with nano and add the names of files or directories that we specifically want git to ignore and NOT track changes to. We don't need git to track changes to the `netherlands-cities.csv` file in the `world_cities_workshop/data/` folder, so let's tell git to ignore it. Open up the .gitignore file by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ nano .gitignore`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see a blank text document in your terminal window. We are going to add to it the name of the file we want to ignore, and we also need to specify the folder that it is in. In nano, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "`data/netherlands-cities.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then hit shift + control + O to write out, enter to confirm, and shift + control + X to close nano and return to your shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you now run `cat .gitignore` you should see the line you just wrote as the contents of this file. You can also use the .gitignore file to ignore whole folders - for example if you are working with large amounts of data, image files, or other files that are either too large, unchanging, or otherwise not useful to be tracked with Git. You can also ignore all files of a certain type following the same pattern-matching strategy we used to select separate files that ended with `*-nl.csv`, or say, all `.jpg` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, since we created the .gitignore file after our last commit, we'll need to add it and commit it so that git knows about its existence and can start ignoring things according to the rules we set. We can do this the same way we added and committed changes to any other file, by:\n",
