    "# Version control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is focused on understanding and implementing version control with Git to keep track of changes to a code-based project. We'll talk about the utility of version control systems for tracking changes to local projects, and how it can be used to enable remote collaboration and crediting of multiple authors to a project hosted in a remote repository like GitHub. This material draws from the [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) lesson from the Software Carpentries. "

    "Mac users need to install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent \"mavericks\" installer from [this list on Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/). Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click Open on the pop up window. After installing Git, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program. For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8) use the most recent available installer labelled \"snow-leopard\" available here. \n",
