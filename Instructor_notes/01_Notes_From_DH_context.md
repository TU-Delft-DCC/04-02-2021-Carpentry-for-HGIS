# Guide to programing with Python for the Digital Humanities

## Finding the Balance Between CS and DH
When I was first given this task of creating Digital Humanities (DH) assignments for
an introductory programming course, I was faced with a serious dilemma: On one hand, I wanted to make sure that theDHstudents received a good introduction to some
of the basic methods of DH research, such as social network analysis, stylometry,
textual analysis, and visualization. But on the other hand, I was merely teaching
an introductory programming course, so I could not expect all of the students to
do professional-grade work, or to write analytical code at the level of functionality
expected of advanced computer science practitioners.

My solution was to try to strike a middle ground between the two ends of the spectrumâ€”
to give all students a solid introduction to DH analytical methods while keeping
the course accessible for novice programmers, using assignments that employ
the strengths of the Python language. So the average student in the course should be able to do a good job of programming the assignment, and should also be able to
learn something about how programming for humanities research is done.

## These are interesting criterion to setup the DH course
- Keep workshop accessible for novice programers
- The student should be able to program the assignment and learn how to program for Dh
- Dont scare novice programmers in the first assignment by providing complex exercises
- Assignments can have different levels of complexity or versions. For instance an assignment can be easier for a certain audience and more challenging for other audiences.

> What is particularly difficult about this task is that it attempts to please a wide range of students. At risk are the computer science (CS) students who only want to learn how to program, and have no interest in the humanities, as well as the DH students who have a great interest in the humanities, but have little or no desire to learn computer programming. The great benefit of having these DH programming assignments is that they are unusual. If you browse the more popular introductory programming in Python textbooks,most of the assignments are math-based, sciencebased, or business-based. Theweb is also filledwith such assignments. SoCSstudents with no interest in the humanities have awholeweb of assignments to use for practice, if they wish to avoid the humanities. Also, DH students who have little interest in learning programming might at least be brought along with assignment topics that are of more interest to them.
