## Run map.py on netherlandsmap.csv

Python is already installed on your computer from the Anaconda all-in-one installer. We can give Python commands directly in the command line by using a specific format that always starts with its name:

1. Change directory to `py_workshop_2021/scripts`: `cd ../scripts`
2. Tell python to run the map.py script on the netherlandsmap.csv file: `python map.py ../data/netherlandsmap.csv`
3. Check out the map - bet it is the first map you've ever seen a turtle draw!

```{admonition} Try on your own
The oregonmap.csv file also works with the map.py script - in fact this is the original data file from the repository owner which we used for the demonstration ((c) 2014 Andrea Cleland). Try drawing a map from oregonmap.csv. 
```
