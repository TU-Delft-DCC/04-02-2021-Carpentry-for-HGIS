    "# Version control and remote collaboration with Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is focused on understanding and implementing version control with Git to keep track of changes to a code-based project. We'll talk about the utility of version control systems for tracking changes to local projects, and how it can be used to enable remote collaboration and crediting of multiple authors to a project hosted in a remote repository like GitHub. This material draws from the [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) lesson from the Software Carpentries. It uses the [Gizmo repository](https://github.com/wmvanvliet/gizmo) from wmvanvliet on GitHub as a basis for Python challenges and to illustrate a track changes workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows users, Git should be installed already on your computer as part of your Bash install from Day 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mac users need to install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent \"mavericks\" installer from [this list on Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/). Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click Open on the pop up window. After installing Git, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program. *Participants should install Git before the start of the lesson*\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed instructions and videos are available here: https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and code for this lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "The material for this lesson is found in the Gizmo Python Challenges repository by wmvanvliet on GitHub. Participants do not need to do anything ahead of the lesson as the first part walks them through forking and cloning a repository on GitHub. The link is here: https://github.com/wmvanvliet/gizmo"

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software code: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people. Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way. You can think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your more recent version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative writing or scripting with traditional word processors and text editors is cumbersome. Either every collaborator has to work on a document sequentially (slowing down the process of writing), or you have to send out a version to all collaborators and manually merge their comments into your document. The ‘track changes’ or ‘record changes’ option can highlight changes for you and simplifies merging, but as soon as you accept changes you will lose their history. You will then no longer know who suggested that change, why it was suggested, or when it was merged into the rest of the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word’s Track Changes, Google Docs’ version history, but they lack a streamlined way to customise messages about changes made and store just one latest version of the file for everyone working on it. It seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document that we keep passing back and forth to create something whole. The result is a lot of files with names like Final_paper_EDIT01.doc or Final_paper_EDITCOMMITTEE03.doc and so on...it can get messy trying to merge suggestions and changes made by multiple people in multiple documents, sent over email...I'm sure we all know the headache!\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a remote collaboration like Git Hub, unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.\n",
    "\n",
    "From [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/): \"GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.\" GitHub hosts code and all files for each project in a **repository**, sometimes shortened to \"repo\". A repository on GitHub is free to create, you can add contributing members and collaborators with different permission settings as you please, and you can access it with a unique URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Individual work\n",
    "Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded).\n",

    "\n",
    "When we use Git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things. The commands we will run only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

    "Another way to verify that our commit was saved is by using the command `git log`, which shows us the project's history of commits. `git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order.

    "3. `$ git commit -m \"<descriptive message>\"` to commit the latest version of file(s) and describe the nature of the changes made\n",

    "- `git status` - shows you which branch you are on, and new message indicating changes will be committed for new file: gizmo.py\n",
    "- `git commit -m \"defined hello function in gizmo.py\"`\n",
    "- what is a commit message and how to write a good one?\n",
