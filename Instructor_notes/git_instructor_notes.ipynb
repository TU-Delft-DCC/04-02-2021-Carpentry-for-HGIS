    "# Version control and remote collaboration with Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is focused on understanding and implementing version control with Git to keep track of changes to a code-based project. We'll talk about the utility of version control systems for tracking changes to local projects, and how it can be used to enable remote collaboration and crediting of multiple authors to a project hosted in a remote repository like GitHub. This material draws from the [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) lesson from the Software Carpentries. It uses the [Gizmo repository](https://github.com/wmvanvliet/gizmo) from wmvanvliet on GitHub as a basis for Python challenges and to illustrate a track changes workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For Windows users, Git should be installed already on your computer as part of your Bash install from Day 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mac users need to install Git for Mac by downloading and running the most recent \"mavericks\" installer from [this list on Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/). Because this installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (control click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click Open on the pop up window. After installing Git, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as Git is a command line program. *Participants should install Git before the start of the lesson*\n",

    "More detailed instructions and videos are available here: https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data and code for this lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "The material for this lesson is found in the Gizmo Python Challenges repository by wmvanvliet on GitHub. Participants do not need to do anything ahead of the lesson as the first part walks them through forking and cloning a repository on GitHub. The link is here: https://github.com/wmvanvliet/gizmo"

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world: it’s what professionals use to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn’t just for software code: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful metadata about them. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people. Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way. You can think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your more recent version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remote collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative writing or scripting with traditional word processors and text editors is cumbersome. Either every collaborator has to work on a document sequentially (slowing down the process of writing), or you have to send out a version to all collaborators and manually merge their comments into your document. The ‘track changes’ or ‘record changes’ option can highlight changes for you and simplifies merging, but as soon as you accept changes you will lose their history. You will then no longer know who suggested that change, why it was suggested, or when it was merged into the rest of the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word’s Track Changes, Google Docs’ version history, but they lack a streamlined way to customise messages about changes made and store just one latest version of the file for everyone working on it. It seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document that we keep passing back and forth to create something whole. The result is a lot of files with names like Final_paper_EDIT01.doc or Final_paper_EDITCOMMITTEE03.doc and so on...it can get messy trying to merge suggestions and changes made by multiple people in multiple documents, sent over email...I'm sure we all know the headache!\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a remote collaboration like Git Hub, unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.\n",
    "\n",
    "From [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/): \"GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.\" GitHub hosts code and all files for each project in a **repository**, sometimes shortened to \"repo\". A repository on GitHub is free to create, you can add contributing members and collaborators with different permission settings as you please, and you can access it with a unique URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Individual work\n",
    "Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded).\n",

    "\n",
    "When we use Git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things. The commands we will run only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

    "* our name and email address,\n",
    "* what our preferred text editor is,\n",

    "## Fork and clone a repository from GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why and when do you fork a repository on GitHub?\n",
    "From [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#:~:text=After%20using%20GitHub%20by%20yourself,contribute%20to%20someone%20else's%20project.&text=Creating%20a%20%E2%80%9Cfork%E2%80%9D%20is%20producing,repository%20and%20your%20personal%20copy.): \"After using GitHub by yourself for a while, you may find yourself wanting to contribute to someone else’s project. Or maybe you’d like to use someone’s project as the starting point for your own. This process is known as forking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a “fork” is producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit Pull Requests to help make other people’s projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Gizmo Python challenges GitHub Repository (https://github.com/aecryan/gizmo)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is a Python challenge. Create pull requests (PR's) to this repository to solve it. Upon PR submission, the GitHub action robots will check your code and report back how well you did. You can then add more commits to your PR until all tests come back green, which means you win! (*note:* you can also do all exercises locally and run the test to check if you pass or fail each exercise, without needing to do a pull request. This is how we will do it in this lesson.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises are meant to test your knowledge of some important features of the Python programming language and the NumPy and Pandas libraries. When it's not immediately obvious to you how to solve an exercise using only a few lines of code, it is likely you can learn a new Python trick by checking the links below the exercise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fork the Gizmo Python challenges repository on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure all participants are signed into their GitHub accounts, and then send the link to the Gizmo Python challenges repository: https://github.com/aecryan/gizmo. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the top right of the repository page, there is a small small gray button that says \"Fork\". Each participant should click this button to create fork - a copy of the main repository - in their own account. Changes made to the forked version of the repository do not affect the original author's work, but if you intend to contribute to their repository you can later create what is called a pull request to integrate your changes/suggestions in their repository. We will not be doing that today but rather running all tests locally. There is more information about how to create a pull request in the Gizmo repository documentation if you are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clone the forked copy of the Gizmo Python challenges repository to your local computer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Gizmo repository on GitHub, locate the green button near the top of the repository page that says \"Code\". When you click it, you will see a menu that includes a link to clone the repository over HTTPS (and several other options like SSH). We will use HTTPS because it is secure and requires no additional configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps here are:\n",
    "1. Copy the link under HTTPS heading \n",
    "2. In the terminal/command prompt, change directory to the Desktop: `cd Desktop`.\n",
    "3. Clone the repository by running the following command in the terminal/command prompt: `git clone https://github.com/aecryan/gizmo.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see a new folder appear on your desktop called gizmo. This contains all the same contents as the remote repository - it is now a local version unique to you. You can make changes here that will not be reflected in the remote version until you tell git to incorporate them to GitHub by \"pushing\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explore the .git folder and local git repo\n",
    "\n",
    "The . git folder contains all the information that is necessary for your project in version control and all the information about commits, remote repository address, etc. All of them are present in this folder. It also contains a log that stores your commit history so that you can roll back to history.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in the Desktop, move into the newly created repository folder: `cd gizmo`. The .git folder is hidden by default, so in order to see it we will need to run the `ls` command with the flag `-a`. Run this in your terminal/command prompt: `ls -a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the credentials we set up earlier with Git? We can see how Git stores those to associated us with each project we create by entering the `config` file that is stored in the .git folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "`cd .git` \n",
    "\n",
    "`cat config`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also check the remote URL of the repository that this local copy is associated with by running the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git remote -v`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the location that all changes will be pushed to (more about this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship between local and remote repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with other people. We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories. In practice, though, it’s easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it on the web rather than on someone’s laptop. Most programmers use hosting services like GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab to hold those master copies, which are sometimes referred to as a \"single source of truth\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you now change directory back to `gizmo` (move one up by `cd ..`) and run the `ls` command, you will see there are two files, README.md and titanic.csv. These are the same files as are on the original repository on GitHub as we have done nothing with them yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the .gitignore file?\n",
    "What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis? Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. What’s worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so we tell Git to ignore them via this .gitignore file in the root (main folder) of our repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can edit this file with nano and add the names of files or directories that we specifically want git to ignore and NOT track changes to. Anything that is listed there will not be tracked by Git. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use `cat` to view what git is ignoring about this repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "`cat .gitignore` \n",
    "\n",
    "See that it is ignoring anything with __pycache__, tags or .pytest_cache in the name.\n"

    "## Using branches with Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Backlog.com](https://backlog.com/git-tutorial/using-branches/):\"In a collaborative environment, it is common for several developers to share and work on the same source code. While some developers will be fixing bugs, others will be implementing new features, etc. With so much going on, there needs to be a system in place for managing different versions of the same code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Git branch is essentially an independent line of development. You can take advantage of branching when working on new features or bug fixes because it isolates your work from that of other team members. Different branches can be merged into any one branch as long as they belong to the same repository.\"\n",

    "### Make a new branch to work on in the Gizmo repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we are probably the only person who is going to work on the fork of the Gizmo Python challenges repository we made, we are going to make a new branch and make all changes on that. There are several advantages to working this way. Mainly, the advantage is that if we make all the changes we see fit on one branch we label with our name, when and if we made a pull request to the original author in the future, that person would be able to easily identify all changes we made in one convenient location. We can simply make a pull request to merge all the features from our new branch into the master branch of the original repository. The owner would then have the ability to look through the changes we propose and decide which they are willing to incorporate. It's a clean way of keeping track of contributions per person.\n",

That is good - it verifies that you are indeed on the new branch with your name. We can make changes in this branch that will not be reflected in the master branch of our forked copy (or anywhere else). If you run `ls` now that you are in your new branch you will see the same files README.md and titanic.csv.

    "### Step 1: Move changes to the staging area with `git add`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project, `git add` specifies what will go in a snapshot (putting things in the staging area), and `git commit` then actually takes the snapshot, and makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you don’t have anything staged when you type git commit, Git will prompt you to use `git commit -a` or `git commit --all`, which is kind of like gathering everyone to take a group photo!

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want to commit as a single snapshot.\n",

    "### Step 2: Commit changes and adding a message with `git commit`\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `git commit`, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add` and stores a copy permanently inside the special .git directory. This permanent copy is called a commit (or revision) and each one has a short identifer code that can be used to point to the version of your file if you ever need to revert back to it or investigate changes made. \n",

If we had made changes to multiple files, for example changed parts of another script, added a new data file, or added lines to a data documentation text file, and we had added those to the staging area as well, we would be writing a commit that summarises the changes to ALL of those files. You can add all the changed files to the staging area at once by using `git add .`, but since we only changed one file we called it by name. Now, we're ready to make the commit by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ git commit -m \"<my message here>\"`\n",

    "Choose a good commit message here - maybe something like \"define hello function in gizmo.py\". Remember, keep it short and sweet, but also memorable.\n",

    "`$ git status`\n",
    "\n",
    "We should see a message that we are on the branch named 'yourname', there is nothing to commit, and the working tree is clean. Nice!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to verify that our commit was saved is by using the command `git log`, which shows us the project's history of commits. `git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order.

    "Now that you're familiar with version control using git AND the basics of working with Python, it's time to try your hand at the remaining challenges in the Python challenges Gizmo repository! You can work completely on your local computer, add and commit the changes you make periodically (whenever you decide, don't forget the accompanying commit message) and test your answers to each challenge using the test_gizmo.py script. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's test the function we wrote to solve exercise 2 by running the test_gizmo.py script. This script tests whether the code you wrote for each challenge accomplished the task - it automatically runs on all fourteen challenges so expect to see a lot of \"failures\" if you've only done two at this point - good motivation! :) \n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, make sure you are in the main folder of the gizmo repository and run: \n",
    "`python -m pytest .tests/test_gizmo.py` \n",
    "\n",
    "In response, you should see a list of tests two to fourteen and a pass/fail marker for each one. At the top there is a list of fourteen characters, if you pass a test it will show a green dot, if you fail it there should be a red F.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Try the rest of the exercises on your own! Good luck! "
