    "Using a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit, create a .csv file called mycountry-cities.csv. Change to the name of your country. Make sure before you save it that you turn it into plain text. In TextEdit this is done by navigating to Format > Make Plain Text. Copy the exact syntax of the netherlands-cities.csv file and list your city, it's coordinates, and its population size in that order. Make sure you do not include spaces in either your city name (if it is multiple words, like The Hague you can either do The-Hague or TheHague) or your lines (every comma should not have a space after it). Population numbers shouldn't have any commas or periods. Each city should have its own line which starts with a \"c\", for city.\n",
