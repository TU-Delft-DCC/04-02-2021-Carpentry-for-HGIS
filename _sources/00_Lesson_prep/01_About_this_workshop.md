# General considerations for this workshop
Learning how to program and how to use programming in your research field requires practice and exercising like almost everything ðŸ˜‡.

**This workshop is composed of two complementary and important sessions**. The morning sessions where we provide guidance, examples and space for discussion; and the afternoon sessions where you are required to practice and apply the concepts and knowledge provided step by step.

## Participation guidelines
We have carefully curated and provided exercises for different levels of complexity. We hope that the first exercises will help you to build confidence and skills to carry on with more advance ones.

- We expect you to do the exercises provided, as they are also part of the learning and knowledge transfer process.
- Try to solve the exercises on your own before asking questions, this is an important part of the training.
- Once you have solved the exercises, give a like in the first comment of the exercises page to know you were able to complete the exercise. 
- Use the comments to ask questions about the exercises. We have setup comments per exercise page so that workshop is more interactive.

<!-- - Once you have read the material provided prior to the morning session, comment on the summary page -->
