# General considerations for this workshop
Learning how to program and how to use programming in your research field requires practice and exercise like almost everything ðŸ˜‡.

**This workshop is composed of two complementary and important sessions**. During the morning sessions we provide guidance, examples and space for discussion; and during the afternoon sessions you are required to practice and apply the concepts and knowledge provided with step-by-step exercises. Your instructors will be available and ready to answer questions if you need help, but you should really try to do these on your own (see below for some tips).

## Participation guidelines
We have carefully curated and provided exercises with different levels of complexity. We hope that the initial exercises will help you to build confidence and skills to carry on with more advanced ones.

- We expect you to do the exercises provided, as they are a crucial part of the learning and knowledge transfer process.
- Try to solve the exercises on your own before asking questions - gaining problem-solving skills in working with code is an important part of the training.
- Once you have solved the exercises, give a "like" to the first comment of the exercises page so we as instructors know you were able to complete the exercise. 
- Use the comments to ask questions about the exercises. We have set up comments on each exercise page so that workshop is more interactive.

<!-- - Once you have read the material provided prior to the morning session, comment on the summary page -->

Some exercises can be optional, for those cases we should clearly specify which are not required.
