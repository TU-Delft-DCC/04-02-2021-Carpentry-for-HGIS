# Acknowledgments
## These are the main sources that have inspired this workshop's material
- This workshop is heavily inspired by the [software carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/) and the [code refineries](https://coderefinery.org/)
- Many of the afternoon exercises are taken from the [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html)lesson.
- We also use [turtle-graphics-map](https://github.com/acleland/turtle-graphics-map) code.
