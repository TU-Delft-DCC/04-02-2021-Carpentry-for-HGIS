# Schedule overview

Each day of the workshop has a morning teaching session (3 hours) and an afternoon session of independent exercises (up to 4 hours). Both are important for making the most out of this workshop experience :). 

Exercises are meant to be explored and executed independently during the afternoons following each morning teaching session of the workshop. The exercises are designed to build upon the information from the morning session and prepare for the next day. Your instructors are available to help in response to comments made on the workshop website. You can find the exercises under the material for each day on the left-hand sidebar.
