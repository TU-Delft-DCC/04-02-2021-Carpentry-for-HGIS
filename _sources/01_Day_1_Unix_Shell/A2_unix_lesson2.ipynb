All the .csv files follow a naming convention that goes `<cityname>-<countryabbreviation>.csv`. `*.csv` matches amsterdam-nl.csv, eindhoven-nl.csv and every file that ends with ‘.csv’. On the other hand, `n*.csv` only matches newyorkcity.csv because the ‘n’ at the front only matches filenames that begin with the letter ‘n’.\n",
