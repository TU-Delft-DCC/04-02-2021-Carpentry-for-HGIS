# Exercise 1

## Generating country population data

Each person should choose a country and source population data for its five largest cities. You can use any site you like and make sure to cite the source. One example is https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries.

An example of how to cite the source of population data for Canada from World Population Review is:

World Population Review. (2021, February 15). Canada Population 2021. Retrieved from https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/canada-population

1. Using a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit, create a .csv file called mycountry-cities.csv. Change to the name of your country. 
2. Make sure before you save it that you turn it into plain text. In TextEdit this is done by navigating to Format > Make Plain Text. 
3. Copy the exact syntax of the netherlands-cities.csv file and list your city, it's coordinates, and its population size in that order. Each city should have its own line which starts with a "c", for city. 

Tips: Make sure you do not include spaces in either your city name (if it is multiple words, like The Hague you can either do The-Hague or TheHague) or your lines (every comma should not have a space after it). Population numbers shouldn't have any commas or periods. 

For example, the entry for New York City would look like this:
c,NewYorkCity,40.7128,74.0060,8419000
