    "2. Make sure before you save it that you turn it into plain text. In TextEdit this is done by navigating to Format > Make Plain Text. \n",

    "Tips: Make sure you do not include spaces in either your city name (if it is multiple words, like The Hague you can either do The-Hague or TheHague) or your lines (every comma should not have a space after it). Population numbers shouldn't have any commas or periods. \n",
