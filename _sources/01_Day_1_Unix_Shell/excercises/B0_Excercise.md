# EXERCISES DAY 1




Like any craft, coding requires patience, curiosity, determination, anticipation, and experimentation. Think of it as a drawing you are constantly trying to improve. You might need to look it from different angles, give it a rest and try to improve it again. Sometimes you might want to make a new version.

The best way to learn how to program is by experimenting and testing commands and code snippets(little pieces of code). We hope that by the end of today you get used to work with the python ecosystem and start developing the craft of coding. We also hope that you can go through all the exercises materials using jupyter notebooks to test the code examples and solve the exercises provided.
