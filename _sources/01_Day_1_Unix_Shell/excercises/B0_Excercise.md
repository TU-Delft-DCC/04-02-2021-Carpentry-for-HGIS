# EXERCISES DAY 1

Like any craft, coding requires patience, curiosity, determination, anticipation, and experimentation.When learning how to program it is crucial that you constantly experiment and test, from simple commands and code snippets(little pieces of code), to entire codebases and libraries.

We hope that by the end of today you get used to work with the python ecosystem and start developing the craft of coding, which means essentially learning how to formulate and solve code problems. We also hope that you can go through all the exercises materials using jupyter notebooks to test the code examples and solve the exercises provided.

## Before getting started
Dont forget to use the comments to ask for help, or discuss issues.
Dont forget to give once you have completed each exercise section.

## Good luck!!
