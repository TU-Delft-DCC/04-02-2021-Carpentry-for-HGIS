Run the test_gizmo.py script which tests the answers you try for each Python challenge: `python -m pytest .tests/test_gizmo.py` This should show a list of tests two to fourteen and pass/fail for each one. At the top there is a list of fourteen characters, if you pass a test it will show a green dot, if you fail it there should be a red F.   \n",
    "2. Try the rest of the exercises (3-12) on your own, running the same command after each one.\n",
    "3. If you need to change something about your answer to make it pass, use: `nano gizmo.py` and make your changes. Don't forget to track and commit changes with Git :) "
