## Use an index to get a single character from a string.

*   The characters (individual letters, numbers, and so on) in a string are
    ordered. For example, the string `'AB'` is not the same as `'BA'`. Because of
    this ordering, we can treat the string as a list of characters.
*   Each position in the string (first, second, etc.) is given a number. This
    number is called an **index** or sometimes a subscript.
*   Indices are numbered from 0.
*   Use the position's index in square brackets to get the character at that
    position.

print(atom_name[0])

## Use a slice to get a substring.

*   A part of a string is called a **substring**. A substring can be as short as a
    single character.
*   An item in a list is called an element. Whenever we treat a string as if it
    were a list, the string's elements are its individual characters.
*   A slice is a part of a string (or, more generally, any list-like thing).
*   We take a slice by using `[start:stop]`, where `start` is replaced with the
    index of the first element we want and `stop` is replaced with the index of
    the element just after the last element we want.
*   Mathematically, you might say that a slice selects `[start:stop)`.
*   The difference between `stop` and `start` is the slice's length.
*   Taking a slice does not change the contents of the original string. Instead,
    the slice is a copy of part of the original string.

## Use the built-in function `len` to find the length of a string.

*   Nested functions are evaluated from the inside out,
     like in mathematics.

## Python is case-sensitive.

*   Python thinks that upper- and lower-case letters are different,
    so `Name` and `name` are different variables.
*   There are conventions for using upper-case letters at the start of variable names so we will use lower-case letters for now.

## Use meaningful variable names.

*   Python doesn't care what you call variables as long as they obey the rules
    (alphanumeric characters and the underscore).

~~~
flabadab = 42
ewr_422_yY = 'Ahmed'
print(ewr_422_yY, 'is', flabadab, 'years old')

{: .language-python}

*   Use meaningful variable names to help other people understand what the program does.
*   The most important "other person" is your future self.

> ## Choosing a Name
>
> Which is a better variable name, `m`, `min`, or `minutes`?
> Why?
> Hint: think about which code you would rather inherit
> from someone who is leaving the lab:
>
> 1. `ts = m * 60 + s`
> 2. `tot_sec = min * 60 + sec`
> 3. `total_seconds = minutes * 60 + seconds`
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > `minutes` is better because `min` might mean something like "minimum"
> > (and actually is an existing built-in function in Python that we will cover later).

> ## Slicing concepts
>
> 1.  What does `thing[low:high]` do?
> 2.  What does `thing[low:]` (without a value after the colon) do?
> 3.  What does `thing[:high]` (without a value before the colon) do?
> 4.  What does `thing[:]` (just a colon) do?
> 5.  What does `thing[number:some-negative-number]` do?
> 6.  What happens when you choose a `high` value which is out of range? (i.e., try `atom_name[0:15]`) 
>
> > ## Solutions
> >
> > 1. `thing[low:high]` returns a slice from `low` to the value before `high`
> > 2. `thing[low:]` returns a slice from `low` all the way to the end of `thing`
> > 3. `thing[:high]` returns a slice from the beginning of `thing` to the value before `high`
> > 4. `thing[:]` returns all of `thing`
> > 5. `thing[number:some-negative-number]` returns a slice from `number` to `some-negative-number` values from the end of `thing`
> > 6. If a part of the slice is out of range, the operation does not fail. `atom_name[0:15]` gives the same result as `atom_name[0:]`.
