    "Use these notes to run this workshop and guide yourself through excercises, they are not necessarily meant to be seen by participants, but it can be helpful for instructors/coinstructors and helpers to understand what is being taught and the rationale behind teaching this workshop. \n",

    "### Lets put it as a user story :) \n",
    "*As an instructor, co-instructor and helper I would like to have some documented guide on how to teach this workshop and facilitate the performance of excercises so that I can keep on track of the lesson and master underlying concepts behind the lesson*\n"

    "## Lesson style\n",
    "These lesson is part of an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) or module. It is designed to be used in the context of the other lessons, and builds up knowledge, excercises and concepts using previous lessons as a foundation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a program that works, to give a full picture, run first source code, then inspect the source code, and try to understand it step by step througout the lesson. The instructor will be reflecting between essential concepts of python and progressively reviewing the code on the basis of the new concepts taught. Therefore the instructor will go back to the source code provided and ask students about specific lines of code.\n",

    "\n",
    "> Python is an object oriented programming language. Unlike procedure oriented programming, where the main emphasis is on functions, object oriented programming stresses on objects.An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object. We can think of class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.\n"
