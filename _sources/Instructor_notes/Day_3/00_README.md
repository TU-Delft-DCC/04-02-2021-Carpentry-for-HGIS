# DAY 3
## Overview
- Introduction to (open) science, and reproducibility
    - It is very common in software development to be able to reproduce programs given a set of prerequisites
        - This might be dependencies needed
## Introduce the main exercise
- Configure git global parameters
- Introduction to social coding and human centered coding
    - Program the right way
        - Save time and focus on fun challenges
        - Automate processes and get rid of tedious work
        - Become more creative 
        - Reuse scripts you have already written
        - Made code more efficient
    - Common issues and mistakes (Overestimating memory)
        - Beginners tend to go fast and want to do complex things, slow down
        - You dont understand the code you wrote, therefore you cant adjust it and its frustrating
        - This bad habit
    - Clean code
        - Provide context
        - For you and for others
    - Dependency management
        - Code is continuously changing
    - Unit testing and testing to write better code
        - Better design and specifications


- Todays challenge
    - Go through a collaborative social coding process
        - Make sure to install pytest
        - We will contribute to an existing codebase
        - We will make new changes to the codebase and apply unit testing as well as version control to it
        
- Start the hands on part
