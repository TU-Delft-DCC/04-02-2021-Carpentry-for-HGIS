# Python essentials for GIS learners

- Currently each lesson's material is in a folder. 
- Each folder has instructors note, no the style of the lesson, notes and also excercise.
- These notes can then be used to create materials for participants, in the form of html, or pdfs using just jupyter notebooks.

## How to use the material
The notes are meant to be used for instructors, co-instructors and helpers to prepare for the lesson.
They provide a sequence of what will happen in the workshop, the sequence of excercises, etc.

## Use jupyter notebooks to write modules and sections of the workshop
We can use jupyter notebooks directly to create eventually a simple static website that people can use, during and after the workshop.
